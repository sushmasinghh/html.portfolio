<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sushma Kumari Singh. I have done masters in microbiology from University of Calcutta and worked as an intern in NICED, Kolkata</p>

<p>I am an inquisitive person who desires to learn about anything, this led me to explore differnt fields. At first, I worked as a content creator for MyRevue and then as a podacst manager for MixORG.</p>

<p>I came into the world of Web development through Udemy. I wanted to learn this skill , however due to lack of structured resources I couldn't learn properly. With the help of Udemy and under the guidance of Dr. Angela Yu, I finally learnt this skill. I am excited and thrilled to embark on this new journey.</p>
<p>I am a motivated science graduate who is hardworking, determined and always keen to learn new things.</p>
